Cosmic Horisons x VS2 compat

Current (done) features:
- Redstone thrusters (global and position modes)
- Different VS gravity per dimensions

WIP features:
- Atmospheric collision: VS ships can get to space (works but has bugs, especially in multiplayer)
- Thruster particles (working on correct particle directions)
- Planet collision: VS ships can enter planets (working on controlling landing location)

Planned features:
- "Drag block", weak thruster that always thrusts retrograde (when redstone powered?)
- Captains chair, allows warping of VS ships and priority over planet coll GUI
